Wordpress REST Api client in Elm
=================================

Currently I'm building and running with this:

```
elm-live --open --pushstate --dir=src/static src/elm/Main.elm --output src/static/Main.js
```
To Do
=====

- [x] Make list entries click through to their corresponding pages

- [x] Add a previous link to the previous blog's address
  So that I don't have to type in a full slug

- [x] At the moment we don't know until we try and render a post page -- and
  its neighbours -- if we need to fetch more data or not. Bu that's the wrong
  place. The right place is in update. So perhaps we should set the previous
  and next as part of the update. Either we set them there or we just check for
  them there. That seems wasteful to calculate the neighbours twice.

- [ ] Now when rendering a blog, if the previous link isn't available, we should
  kick off a request for the next page of entries, and when those arrive we should
  redraw and recalculate whether the previous is available

  - [x] The problem here was that when we're rendering it, its too late, we
    need to do that during update. So first we have to refactor the code
    so that the neighbours get recalculated  when a) we visit a single entry
    page or, b) when we receive more data from the server which might provide
    neighbours for an antry we didnt previously have neighbours for.


- [x] Create separate module for Wordpress REST API

- we're going to need to get at the response headers which means we'll need
  expectStringResponse and the only way to set that up is apparently to 
  build a custom request

- [x]  We may chose to use
   [HttpBuilder](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/lukewestby/elm-http-builder/5.0.0/HttpBuilder)
   for this to make it easier to build up the request.

- [x] Try using
  [elm-date-extra](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/justinmimbs/elm-date-extra/2.0.1/Date-Extra#fromIsoString)
  to parse and format iso dates instead of Date.Format

- [x] Switching to the `date_gmt` -- and adding a Z to force UTC interpretation
  when decoding -- has solved, finally, the problem of fetching duplicate
  entries as neighbours. But now I notice that the time displayed in each post
  is an hour out, as if some time zone is being applied to it without my
  approval

- [x] Make the single page view just expand one entry in the list flow

- [x] When we click a card to view the details, that card's `offsetTop`
  should be stored and we should scroll to that position.
   
  We get the new scroll distance from a card when we click it which is of
  course before we render the new page.  There are problems with this. If there
  is an expanded card above the one you click the scroll height we move to
  includes the height of that expanded card which won't be there after we
  redraw. So the new height isn't right.  And if we go to a card directly via
  the url we don't have a scroll distance for it. 

  So we need to calculate the appropriate new scroll height either from 
  first principles about the height and number of cards in the stack (which
  might lay the groundwork for reverse infinite scroll) or after we have
  rendered the new page, when things are in their correct final positions.

  - So what if we knew the width of the containing div, and of the cards?
    Cards could have fixed width, and probably should. And we can get the size
    of the div using DOM library in a task. Kick off a task when we start the
    program (do we need to have rendered a frame yet?) and have a subscription
    for window resize events and check it again.  As we have to reflow anyway.
    Then we know how the cards stack in the grid and we should be able to
    calculate the position that the top of a given expanded card *should* be.

 - If we get the window size, and maintain it, we can override the MDL
   calculated column widths and set the main column size to something we 
   know is an exact multiple of the card width.

- [ ] Clicking on an open card should maybe close it -- return to the list view?

- [ ] Should scrolling off an open entry also close it?

- [ ] Going straight to the url of a single page view needs to scroll us to the
relevant entry otherwise we cant see it.

- [ ] use continuous scroll

- [ ] We need a way to trigger fetching more entries when navigating the list
  view. Ideally that would be triggered by scrolling. 
  
  - [x] Have to look into infinite scroll.

  In fact the whole thing could work like this and we can:

- [x] get rid of those pesky prev and next arrows. Which means we don't need to
  always be showing the header bar!

- [ ] Do we need a way to know if we've reached the actual beginning or end of the 
  list of entries so as to avoid repeatedly requesting the next page at the end?

  The response headers give us that information, or maybe just getting back
  fewer than the expected page number.

- [x] Add classes or ids on summary cards in list view to help testing

  - When we get a location we are going to parse the slug out of it.  Then the
    Msg will be to view the corresponding page.  But, at first, we won't have
    data for that so we will kick off a get request for it (do we need to keep
    the slug in the model at this point, and make a note that we're awaiting
    it?) We will be in a loading state and shoudl probably display a loading
    message (as the page) during that state.

 - Then once we get the data we can store it in the array, and set the current
   page to be the index of the corresponding page in our array.

 - We might get a response that says the slug can't be found in which case were
   going to transition to a proper 404 page.

 - We need a way to get a route from a Location, and a Location (url) from 
   a page.


- [ ] Adding buttons to cards is going to entail giving each one an unique button id number
