Wordpress REST Api client in Elm
=================================

Currently I'm building and running with this:

```
elm-live --open --pushstate --dir=src/static src/elm/Main.elm --output src/static/Main.js
```
To Do
=======

- [ ] Add a previous link to the previous blog's  
  So that I don't have to type in a full slug

- [ ] Make list entries click through to their corresponding pages
